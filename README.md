# A simple way to get started with data visualizations using d3 and coffeescript

## Usage

### First Clone the Repository

```
git clone git@github.com:vlandham/vis.git
cd vis
```

### You might consider creating a new branch for your Vis

```
git checkout -b interesting_new_bar_chart
```

### Install requirements

use `npm` to get things installed

```
npm install
```

### Build and Serve

Use `grunt` to get things built

```
grunt
```

Now visit http://localhost:8080 and open the console to see some output.

### Start Coding

The main vis code is in `src/vis.js` and the data loading is in `src/main.js`.

I am using babel and browserify - so you can use es6 and `require` as you see fit.
